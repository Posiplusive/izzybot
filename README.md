# Izzy Moonbot

This is the github page for Moonbot. Currently in a very alpha stage. Expect crashes. (maybe)

## Usage

Make a file called token.txt and put your token in there. The bot will read it and use it to get online.
Simply run `go build` and then just `./izzybot`.

TODO:
- Implement Derpibooru post grabber
- Implement configuration ability
- Code cleanup
- Advanced moderation features
